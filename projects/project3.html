  <h1>Via Alpina Trek Itinerary</h1>

  <div class="itinerary-details">
    <h2>Day 1 – Arrive in Vaduz | Liechtenstein Warm-Up Walk</h2>
    <p>
      Arrive by train in Sargans or Buchs, Switzerland, then take a bus to Vaduz, the capital city of the mountainside Principality of Liechtenstein. The tour will start at 2:00 pm with a short warm-up walk up to Vaduz Castle, the palace and residence of Liechtenstein’s ruling family. There is no border control between Switzerland and Liechtenstein, but you'll want to stop at the tourism office to have your passport ceremonially stamped. Then, take a photo of yourself standing on the official starting point of the Via Alpina in the pedestrian center of cosmopolitan Vaduz. In the evening, enjoy an orientation and welcome dinner. Overnight in Vaduz.

    <h2>Day 2 – Vaduz to Weisstannen</h2>
    <p>
      A morning transfer from Vaduz, Liechtenstein to the Sargans castle in Sargans, Switzerland positions us to get our first Via Alpina route stamp. We then make our way to Mels for a quick ascent to high alpine pastures, where our route follows an undulating course through woods and meadows with relaxing views of the Weisstannental and its many waterfalls. We pass a dozen or more streams and rivulets cascading down the hillside. The Weisstannental is the canton of St. Gallen’s longest valley, and we arrive at our hotel along a mountain stream in the peaceful village of Weisstannen. Overnight in Weisstannen.

    <h2>Day 3 – Weisstannen to Elm</h2>
    <p>
      As we continue ascending the Weisstannental, the route narrows and becomes more rugged before passing above a giant chasm leading to the high meadows at Fooalp. Crossing our first pass, the Foopass (pronounced FOE-pass), takes us to an elevation of 7300 feet and gives you a taste for the more challenging alpine passes ahead. The descent to Elm offers stunning scenery with many large waterfalls streaking the hillsides. Elm is located in the heart of the Sardona Tectonic Arena, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is known for its specialty foods including fine chocolates and pastries. Overnight in a spa hotel in the heart of Elm.

    <h2>Day 4 – Elm to Braunwald</h2>
    <p>
      From Elm, enjoy views of the Martinsloch, a giant hole in the Alps that reveals the geological forces that shaped the area. A morning bus will speed you from Elm to a ski hut at Obererbs. The ascent is steep as you reach the narrow saddle marking the Richetlipass at 7418 feet. The descent from the pass is unusually steep down to Unterstafel, so be surefooted and consider using trekking poles as you take your time. Arriving in the valley center of Linthal, you’ll find a funicular ready to whisk you to the car-free alpine resort of Braunwald, set on a grassy slope with mesmerizing mountain views, including the glaciated Tödi massif, the highest mountain in the Glarner Alps. Spend the evening basking in the mountain views and starlit sky. Overnight in Braunwald.
